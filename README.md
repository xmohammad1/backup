<h1 align="left">How does it work</h1>

<p align="left">Then it asks us for bot token, you have to create a bot from https://t.me/BotFather and give the token</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Step 3: Set chat id</h3>

###

<p align="left">Then it asks us for a chat ID, and to get your chat ID or the channel you set aside for backup, you must forward a message from yourself or the channel to this https://t.me/userinfobot bot, which will give you a chat ID.</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Step 4 : Caption setting</h3>

###

<h3 align="left">Step 5 : Cronjob setting</h3>

###

<p align="left">The next step asks you to run a cron job to determine when the robot will back up and send<br>whose format is like this:<br>0 1<br>The first value, which is 0, is the minute, and the second value, which is 1, is the hour<br>The minimum number for minutes is 0 and the maximum is 60<br>The minimum number for the hour is 0 and the maximum is 24<br>Enter 0 for both to set backup once every minute<br>In the example above, it is backed up once every hour<br>Note that there is a space between both values</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Step 6 : Panel selection</h3>

###

<p align="left">The next step will ask you which panel you want to backup<br>You have to choose one from marzbn, x-ui, and hiddify <br>The value of m means marzban, the value of x means x-ui, and the value of h means hiddify <br>Enter an option between x/m/h as per your requirement</p>

###

<h3 align="left">Step 7 : question of removing previous crown jobs</h3>
